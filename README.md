## Introduction

This script is intended to provide a mining experience in Roblox games. It generates a multi-layered mine with various types of ores. Players can use a pickaxe to mine these ores, which are distributed across the layers of the mine. The script also features cave generation and carving.

## Features

- Multi-layered mine with different types of ores.
- Ore generation based on layers and rarity.
- Cave generation with randomness and carving.
- Real-time mining interactions.
- Automatic mine reset and regeneration.

## Usage

To use this script in your Roblox game, follow these steps:

1. Copy the entire script code.
2. Create a new script object in Roblox Studio.
3. Paste the script code into the new script object.
4. Place the script in the appropriate location within your game's hierarchy.

## Functions

### GenerateRandomRock(Y)

This function generates a random rock (ore) based on the Y position, determining the layer and rarity of the ore.

### CarveCave(StartPos)

This function generates a cave carving starting from the specified position. It carves a cave using a combination of randomness and likelihood factors.

### PlaceStone(X, Y, Z, FromCave)

This function places a stone block in the mine. It's used for both ore placement and carving cave borders.

### CreateNewMine()

This function generates a new mine layout by placing stones in a grid pattern. It's used to reset and regenerate the mine.

### MiningStatusChange(Player, Object, Status, PickaxeDelay)

This function handles the beginning and end of mining interactions. It plays pickaxe sounds and updates occupied status.

### MineRequest(Player, Object)

This function handles mining completion. It updates the player's inventory and removes the mined ore from the mine layout.

### PlayerJoined(Player)

This function is called when a player joins the game. It creates a player-specific folder for data storage.
